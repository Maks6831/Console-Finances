### Project Description 

The purpose of this project was to design and create a portfolio webpage using bootstrap. The webpage contains a bootstrap navbar, jumbotron and utilizes cards to showcase the projects I have created during the course of the bootcamp thus far. All links have a hover effect and 
and all buttons have a box shadow effect on hover. The Work section utilizes the Bootstrap grid layout and the cards are designed so that when the end user hovers over them the project description and button appear.
